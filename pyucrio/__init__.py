The PyUCRio package provides data access and analysis support for working 
with UCalgary Riometer instruments, such as NORSTAR Riometers, and SWAN Hyper
Spectral Riometers.

For an overview of usage and examples, visit the
[UCalgary Space Remote Sensing Open Data Platform](https://data.phys.ucalgary.ca), 
view the [crib sheets](https://data.phys.ucalgary.ca/working_with_data/index.html#crib-sheets),
or explore the examples contained in the [Github repository](https://github.com/ucalgary-srs/pyUCRio/tree/main/examples).

Installation:
```console
pip install pyucrio
```

Basic usage:
```python
import pyucrio
rio = pyucrio.PyUCRio()
```
